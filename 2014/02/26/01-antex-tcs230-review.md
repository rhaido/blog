summary: Quick and honest review of Antex TCS230 - temperature controlled soldering iron. ![pcb](http://blog.grozak.com/galleries/antex_tcs230/IMG_1277.JPG)

Recently I've started to study electronics, and immediately I realised, that I
need to master soldering in order to be able to assemble my project to make them
permanent. After long reserach and reading a lot of reviews and opinions, I've
chosen to buy the temperature controlled soldering iron, because it's smaller,
still has temperature control and cheaper than the soldering station. In my deep
belief in european quality and history, I decided to pay the honest price and 
to buy a European-brand instrument: Antex TCS230 soldering iron - from the [Antex](http://antex.co.uk)
itself.

So, here the story starts. After waiting almost three weeks, I've finally
received the item. Immediately I've noticed, that the quality was far from what
had been expected. Such small cosmetic things, like not accurately glued sticker,
which was badly printed in addition (see the teperature scale lines), were obvious:

Common, Antex, is it that difficult to print and glue the bloody sticker
accurately on the soldering iron which costs 60 pounds?

The handle itselft feels very plasticy and cheep (&copy; [Dave
Jones](http://eevblog.com)), and the parts adjustment is poor - just look at this:

Then I decided to examine the quality of the soldering of the PCB inside the
handle, and I was horrified - pictures will tell you more, than I do:

In addition to the terrible quality of soldering inside the iron, on the next
picture you can see some other defects:

- the left leg of the right resistor in front has the piece of the burnt foam -
  that is the number one sign of the overheating
- the PCB itself is slightly bent inward
- look at the wires near solder connections - the isolation is burnt and
  damaged

The blobs of solder are everywhere:

Antex, I'm a real novice in the soldering, but I'm sure - even I can do
much better, especially if I want to sell it to somebody!

In the same time, I would say, that the initial design - i.e. idea - seems to be
not bad, tips are fine, and ceramics heating element is quiet well done, and it's
put inside the steel tube for additional protection:

Also it's well isolated - to hours of lead-free soldering with ~280&deg;
without any noticable heating of the handle:

At the end, it works despite all the horror inside.

Anyway, after I've noticed all these rubbish, I started to feel really
upset. For the same money - more or less - I could buy Goot PX-201 or Hakko FX-600
or Weller W 61 - and these irons at least look much nicer! The
interested person can find without any problems the photos of Goot's PCB -
well-made and quality soldering, accurate and clean. Also I'm
feeling, that nowadays, even if you are ready to pay reasonable money for the
instrument from well-known brand, - don't tell me, that Antex is not! - it
doesn't mean at all, that you receive the proportional quality! In this
situation, I really start to think, that maybe I should switch to the tools from
chinese manufacturese - the quality from some brands, like Quick or Atten, seems
to be decent with the acceptable price tag.

This tool is supposed to be made in the UK - if it's true and if it's a trend,
we are in a big trouble, colleagues!

One more time - I was always protecting the point of view, that people
should by good tools - but in a situation, that you can not beleive really to
the brand name and the promises, what rests? How can I personally recommend this tool to my
friend, when the price is not proportional to quality you receive? Of course I
won't! Now I really start to understand the real reason of the popularity of
chinese products - at least, there are no illusions.

Thank you for looking at this small article and have a good day!
