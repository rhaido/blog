summary: Quick and honest review of Antex TCS230 - temperature controlled soldering iron. ![pcb](http://blog.grozak.com/galleries/antex_tcs230/IMG_1277.JPG)

Recently I've started to study electronics, and immediately I realised, that I
need to master soldering in order to be able to assemble my projects to make them
permanent - and for this you need a soldering iron or station.
After a lot of research and reading, I decided to buy the temperature controlled
soldering iron and not a station, because it's smaller,
still has temperature control and cheaper than the soldering station. With my deep
belief in european quality and history, I bought an instrument from British
brand [Antex](http://antex.co.uk) -
[TCS230](http://http://www.antex.co.uk/soldering/standard-soldering-irons/tcs230/).

## Cosmetics and build quality

So, here the story starts. After waiting almost three weeks, I've finally
received the item. Immediately I've noticed, that the quality was far from what
had been expected. Such small cosmetic things, like a sticker not glued
accurately, which is in addition badly printed (see the teperature scale lines),
are obvious:

Come-on, Antex, is it that difficult to print and glue the bloody sticker
accurately on the soldering iron which costs 60 pounds (~75 Euros)?

The handle itselft feels very plasticy and cheap (&copy; [Dave
Jones](http://eevblog.com)), and the adjustment of the parts is poor - just look at this:

Then I decided to examine the quality of the soldering of the PCB inside the
handle, and look at this:

In addition to the terrible quality of soldering inside the iron, on the next
picture you can see some other defects:

- the left leg of the right resistor in front has a piece of the burnt foam -
  that is the number one sign of the overheating
- the PCB itself is slightly bent inward
- look at the wires near solder connections - the isolation is burnt and
  damaged

The blobs of solder are everywhere:

I'm a real novice in the soldering, but I'm sure - even I can do
much better, especially if I want to sell it to somebody!

## Usage

In the same time, I would say, that the design is not bad overall, tips are fine,
and ceramic heating element is very good, and it's
placed inside the steel tube for additional protection and better heat
transmission:

I should also note, that the ergonomics is quite good, and short heater allows
more precise operation.

Also it's well isolated - hours of lead-free soldering with 310&deg;-320&deg; on
the tip without any noticable heating of the handle.

At the end, it works very well despite all the horror inside. I can also add, that the
soldering iron with PVC cable is extremely uncomfortable to work - sometime PVC
cable simply outweights the iron in the stand!

As a comparison, I have another temperature controlled soldering iron from
Japanese brand [Goot](http://www.goot.co.jp/en/) - [PX-201](http://www.goot.jp/en/handakote/px-201/).
It's a well made instrument with very good price tag; the interested person can find without
any problems [photos of Goot's
internals](http://easyelectronics.ru/payalnik-goot-px-201.html). Although Goot's
iron is built far better, than this Antex, but from the point of view of design
(ergonomics, operation) and heating element construction the latter outperforms the first. 

Anyway, I'll try to write the back to back review of of these irons soon - and
keep you updated!

Thank you for looking at this small article and have a good day!
