summary: Quick and honest review of controversial Antex TCS230 - temperature controlled soldering iron. :)![pcb](http://blog.grozak.com/galleries/antex_tcs230/IMG_1277.JPG)

Recently I've started to study electronics, and immediately realized, that
soldering absolutely needs to be mastered, - and for this you need a soldering
iron or a station.
After some research and reading, I decided to buy the temperature controlled
soldering iron, primarily because it's much more compact,
still has temperature control and cheaper than the soldering station (within the
same brand). With my deep belief in the European quality, I bought an instrument from British
brand [Antex](http://antex.co.uk) -
[TCS230](http://http://www.antex.co.uk/soldering/standard-soldering-irons/tcs230/)
and here the story starts.

## Time, Cosmetics and Build Quality

After waiting almost three weeks, I finally received the item. Immediately
it was noticed, that the quality was far from the expected one.
Such things, like badly printed and inaccurately glued sticker, were obvious
even during brief examination:

The handle itself feels very plasticy and cheap (&copy; [Dave
Jones](http://eevblog.com)), and the adjustment of the parts is poor - just look at this:

Then I decided to examine the quality of the soldering of its PCB:

From my point of view, the soldering is quite inaccurate; and in addition, on the next
picture you can see some other defects:

- the left leg of the right resistor in front has a piece of the burnt foam -
  that is the number one sign of the overheating
- the PCB itself is bent inward slightly
- look at the wires near solder connections - the isolation is burnt and
  damaged

The blobs of solder are everywhere:

I'd personally do it much better, if I was going to sell it to somebody!

## Usage

Strangely enough, it works very well despite the mess inside. 
I should admit, that the design is decent, tips are the quality
ones, and ceramic heating element is wonderful, being placed inside a metallic tube
for additional protection and better heat transmission:

After several months of usage I concluded, that the ergonomics is also quite good,
and a heater of a shorter than usually length allows precise operation. The handle
doesn't warm up excessively even after several hours of lead-free soldering with
310&deg;-320&deg;.

The sole "but", which is left, is the PVC cable of this instrument. It is so
uncomfortable and heavy; if not operated cautiously it can even pull out the iron
from the stand with all corresponding consequences! Madness!

As a comparison, I have another temperature controlled soldering iron from
Japanese brand [Goot](http://www.goot.co.jp/en/) - [PX-201](http://www.goot.jp/en/handakote/px-201/).
It's a well made instrument with very good price tag; an interested person can find [photos of Goot's
internals](http://easyelectronics.ru/payalnik-goot-px-201.html). Although Goot's
iron is far better built, than "TCS230", but from the point of view of design
(ergonomics), operation and heating element the latter outperforms the first one.

Anyway, I'll try to write the back to back review of of these irons soon - and
keep you updated!

Thank you for looking at this small article and have a good day! 

## Update, 11.03.2014

I contacted Antex with all my issues, and received the following explanations:

> * The black handle labels were found to be substandard throughout our stock & this
> has been taken up with the supplier. This is something we buy in & will now be
> regularly quality inspected.
> * Handle moulding: We have checked our stocks & all seem to be to specification.
> We mould these here & our mould tool was also inspected & found to be in order.
> We believe this instance is a “one off.”
> * With regards to the soldering “quality/join size. These joints appear larger
> because they are “mechanical” joints, which we are obliged (by law) to use
> because of the 230volt supply to the board.

Although the solder blobs are hardly excused by "mechanical" joint, the rest
looks more or less valid. As a compensation I've received silicon cable for this
iron free of charge ;)
