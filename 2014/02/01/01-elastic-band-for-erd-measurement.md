Being amature wheelbuilder, you must really carefully measure the rim ERD
(effective rim diameter), one of the most fundamental characteristics of the
rim. For wheelbuilding purposes, i.e. practically and not formally, ERD could
be defined as the distance between opposite ends of the spokes with nipples
screwed on them just for the full thread engagement and not more the this. n
other words, you:

- take 2 spokes
- protrude them through the opposite holes of the rim
- screw on them the nipples until the full thread engagement

- measure the distance between spoke ends

So, you've put the spokes and nipples into the rim, but how to measure the
distance? Roger Musson in his great ["The
Professional Guide to Wheel
Building"](http://www.wheelpro.co.uk/wheelbuilding/book.php), which I really
recommend to each beginner, proposes to use the
two cutted up to 20cm spokes: measure the difference between then
while being inserted in the rim with nipples and then calculate the
ERD using the formula _ERD = 2 x 20 + measured distance_.

But practical using of this trick in the home conditions was a bit difficult for
me  - you should keep the rim stable, hold the spokes as straight as possible, hold the
ruler and them make the correct measurement. So, I was literally forced to
engage my brain, and I've figured out, that to free hands and not hold the
spokes all the time I can use the simple small elastic band on uncutted spokes
in order to hold them together!

So, the ERD measurement algorithm for me looks like this:

- take 2 spokes
- mark 20 cm from the threaded end
- screw on them the nipples until the full thread engagement
- stretch an elastic band between the bent ends of the spokes
- measure the distance between marks and then calculate the ERD using
  aforementioned formula.

The overall picture looks like this in my case:

As the result, now you can make the measurements with rules with great confidence and
precision :)))

I hope you've liked the trick!
