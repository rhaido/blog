summary: It is my first lightweight build with low number of spokes.![tune_and_mavic](http://blog.grozak.com/galleries/wheels/mavic_cosmic_carbon_tune_1.JPG)

Recently I've build the pair of very interesting wheels for my friend and
colleague Mark Buttner. Here is the spec:

- rims: Mavic Cosmic Carbon SSC
- hubs: Tune Mag 170 & Tune Mig 70
- spokes & nipples - Sapim CX-ray & Sapim special internal brass nipples
- spoke number: 16 spokes in front and 20 spokes in rear wheels.
- lacing: front - radial, rear - 2-cross rear.
- spoke length: 264mm front, 274mm DS & 278mm NDS - rear.

I can not say the build was a particularly easy one, but the result seems to be
fine and looks great.

Initially, from my point of view, it was all wrong:
twisted bladed spokes here and there demonstrated the absence of special
spoke holding key, resulting in a simply ugly build. When I dismantled the
wheel, it turned out, that the initial builder used just simple alu nipples,
turned upside down, which is absolutely wrong - you need special either hex or
square brass nipple for such kind of thinks, this specially prepared head. I
used the brass Sapim ones, as I'm fed up with oxidized alu nipples here and
there.

As you might se
