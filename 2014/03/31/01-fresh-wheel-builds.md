summary: It is my first lightweight build with low number of spokes.![tune_and_mavic](http://blog.grozak.com/galleries/wheels/mavic_cosmic_carbon_tune_1.JPG)

Recently I've build the pair of very interesting wheels for my friend and
colleague Mark Buttner. Here is the spec:

- rims: Mavic Cosmic Carbon SSC
- hubs: Tune Mag 170 & Tune Mig 70
- spokes & nipples - Sapim CX-ray & Sapim special internal brass nipples
- spoke number: 16 spokes in front and 20 spokes in rear wheels.
- lacing: front - radial, rear - 2-cross rear.

I can not say the build was a particularly easy one, but the result seems to be
fine and looks great
