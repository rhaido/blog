summary: Soldering: tips, videos and guides for beginners

So, what can an average Joe like me contribute to the so many times discussed
topic of soldering of electronics components? Strangely enough, I

## PACE Videos
PACE - is a famous and established manufacturer of a soldering equipment for
electronics. Back in 80s (?) they produced a beautiful serie of videos, which
will give you almost ALL necessary information you need to start soldering. Yes,
it does not cover SMT component soldering, but the moment you have a good
understanding of basic tecnique, and the moment you produce clean and nice
soldering of through-hole components - SMT will not pose ANY problem to you (you
might have to change a tip though).

Here this masterpieces are:
...

First video explains you almost all - if not really all - the magic of
soldering, the process of heat transfer, heat capacitance etc. Video is very
actual even today, and it states one very important thing:

## You do not need fancy tools to make good soldering joints
Do not listen anybody telling you otherwise. Temperature control is a praised
feature by internet - and yes, it is actually very good if done properly - but
absense of it does not really prevent you from doing good soldering work. Look
at these shots:

...

They were done with just decent properly chosen mains soldering irons, without
any control except WPI :)

There are so much factors about proper temperature control then could
be seen at a first glance: state of the surface, tip thermal mass, connection between
tip and heating element, lag of temperatures between tip and sensing element, wattage, recovery
speed, state of the surfaces and so on - then it can simply lead you off the
soldering process itself, which will **prevent** you from any soldering at all.

From my personal experience:  my first soldering iron was with temperature
contol, and I spent much more time in wondering, why the iron with temperature set to
320 degrees does not really want to solder component leads to stripboards of
width 2.2 mm, with 1.6mm of a tip width.

At a certain level with a certain skill the understanding will come on its own,
just take you time to learn basics and progress.

## Choose a proper mains iron with adequate wattage.
It looks like I am agitating for the simple mains soldering irons, and indeed I
am :) Still, soldering iron will cost you some money, but will be years and
years in service - for example, some of the Antex irons are well known to serve
for 20+ years.
So, wattage: usually, with mains soldering iron it wattage is proportional to
temperature. Therefore, choose a one you can control better, but as a starting
point, if your soldering does not frequently include soldering of 1mm+ wires,
stick to 15-20 watt range. Here is the brands, absolutely worth looking and
investing money **in Europe**:

- ERSA (Germany)
- JBC (Spain)
- Antex (UK)

I omitted Weller (Germany) as they are known for there soldeing stations, not
for mains-powered irons  from my perspective.

Any unit from these reputable manufacturers will have:

- good heating element
- great ergonomics: although it is HIGHLY personal, the design of the units
  have been polished for quite some time,  thus providing certain stable
  combination
- reasonable recovery time (how long does it take to heat back to the
  after contact with surfaces).
- good choice of tips (Antex is although lacking variety a bit, does not have
  chisel/screwdriver tip for C and CS range)
- replacement part are available and will not suddenly disappear; it is often
  possible to rebuild faulty unit even 10 years after initial purchase.

The most famous irons from these manufacturers are:

- Ersa: Multitip (classic models + recent addition MultiPro (20w)
- JBC 
- Antex: C-15 (15w) and CS-18 (18w) are living classic of soldering irons

There is nothing more to add, except, if you solder bigger joints more often,
choose more powerful iron.

## Holywar and flame-generator topic: damp sponge vs brass wool sponge
Again, look at the PACE videos - for me it is clear, that the best practice is
to use both. Brass woll - sponge "heat shock" - soldering - and you will always
be fine. If only one thing is possible for you, take into account the following
things:
- damp sponge is a bit better against chemical residues and smaller
  contamination
- brass wool is better against stronger contamination, also cleaning the whole
  tip body is possible

All these statements are confirmed by me and by other colleagues. One thing, that
after tip tinning and wiping it with damp sponge, it looks much brighter, then
after a brass wool.

## Thickness of a solder wire
Again, it is WPI: how much solder you use to create a solder joint. Obviously,
thicker wire will have more solder per unit of length, then the thinner wire -
therefore, you will be able have a finer control over the process with the
thinner wire. Therefore, the diameter of solder wire is something between 0.35mm
and 0.5mm as upper limit. Again, do not use neither too small diameter, - as you
probably do not want to feed 10 cm of wire for one joint, - nor too big for the
opposite reasons (creation of solder blobs).

## Leaded vs Lead-free
For amature use the answer is clear: leaded solder in most suitable for you
combination. Lead-free fluxes are more toxic, and **FLUX** - not a solder
compound itself - poses the main danger to your health. Also, for medical, military and aeronatic
purposes, where the quality of the connection is critical, the leaded solder
**should be** used. Read more about car whiskers.

Lead free solder has higher melting point, requiring longer heat application,
thus there is more risk - not too much, but still more - to damage a component.
to the components. I personally started with lead free, as I was way too
imaginative, and struggled with it - altough managed at the end, but wasted a
lot of time to produce reasonable quality of solder joints.
