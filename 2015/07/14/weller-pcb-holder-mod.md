summary: A mod for Weller <model here> PCB holder to improve clamping of the smaller boards. Make sure to read the UPDATES section.

## Problem
Weller is a good circuit board holder, probably the best design you can buy for
reasonable money. Still, it has certain number of drawbacks, and one of them is
very uncomfortable and flimsy holding of the small (9x9 dots and less)
perfboards and stripboards either in the traditional horizontal position of
jaws or in the vertical position, as grooves are either too deep and do not
allow access to the whole soldering area or in the second case the load is
unevenly distributed between the jaws and rotation of the board becomes very
problematic due to overall freeplay of the construction.

## Solution
I tried to address the issue with as simplest possible approach using materials
and tools available to any electronics enthusiast, and here is a result:

The following materials have been used in order to build the board:

- pieces of stripboard, cut to the necessary form with the modelist's fretsaw
- 1mm copper enamelled wire cut to the 17.5 mm length, 6 pieces

Be careful and patient while cutting the stripboard - it is crucial to the
overall success. After cutting out two separate details, you must file off the
differences between them and cut grooves for PCBs.

First, the enamel was stripped off the ends of pre-cut wires; then the prepared
pieces of wire were tapped into the board, and then soldered it using 25w
soldering iron - as simple as that! Beware, that additionally you might need to
file the ends of wire depending on the diameter of the hole - I used standard
cheap non-fibreglass phenolic board and it was perfect.

Also, please note, that the ability of the metallic holding hand to manoeuvre
should not be affected by the jaws, thus the space between it and the jaw it's
mounted on should be taken into account.

## UPDATES

- It was discovered, that it's impossible to use component holder for the
  boards smaller then the sponge, as i simply won't get through the opening of
  the "added" jaws. The following design of the "board" part was proposed to fix
  an issue:
