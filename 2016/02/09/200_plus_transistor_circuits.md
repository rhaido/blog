summary: Fully rebuilt and rectified version of famous Talking Electronics 200+ transistor circuits

_Disclaimer: I do not benefit from this work, and I do not sell kits from this
manual - all original links are saved, and Colin is the only source of them.
In the original doc some circuits are used without any original authorship
specified - this is something to be checked and fixed._

There is a great project in the Internet named "200 Transistor Circuits",
created by Colin Mitchell. It's a collection of small, but very useful
and workable circuits, perfect for understanding the practical aspects of
electronics and training your soldering skills. It is mainly intended for the
beginners: they can build a lot of circuits, which can be lately used as parts
of more complex circuits like 'contruction bricks'; experienced users can also
enjoy it a lot.

**At the end, it is how you really should learn electronics - by doing it :D**

This project exists for quite some time, and it incorporates circuits not only
from Colin himself, but from quite some sources over the web, like EDN, etc.
The difference is, that the circuit usually - but not always - should be built
and tested to get there, although sometimes - rarely - they do not work the way
you expect them to work. Sometimes I find some strange behaviour of the circuit,
or that the circuit does not really work at all - it makes it even funnier in
reasonable quantities, of course.

It's all good, but the project itself lacks a good offline version - which
should be usable on the Kindle-like devices, with electronic ink screens, with
proper internal navigation, content section and so on. In addition, the PDF
version of the document is behind the online version of the document for at
least half of the year. So, I decided to produce fully up-to-date version with
all necessary features myself, merging two books in one along the way - because
they reference each other internally, and should not really be viewed as
separate entities.

So, here is the the quick sum of the project:

- Pandoc Markdown was used as a markup language
- Project is absolutely free and available as the [github repo
here](https://github.com/rhaido/200_transistor_circuits_united)
- Several builds of documents can be found there:

    1. **200_transistor_circuits.pdf** - with all photos
    1. **200_transistor_circuits-light.pdf** - without photos, ~13 pages shorter, more
        optimized for ebook readers.
    1. **200_transistor_circuits.epub** - EPUB build of the lightweight document.

- With all questions about the circuits and for buying kits - write directly to
  Colin
- Pull-requests, fixes and improvements are welcome; make sure fixes to the
  Coin's circuits reach Colin.

The build will be maintained and syncronized regularly, - if you spot the
difference, just let me know.
