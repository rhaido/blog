summary: Brief reviews of the first two CX races of the season.

## 05.10.2013 - Cormoz, Ain, France

Small, compact, but very good and technically difficult race. In total, if you
are an average Joe like me, it offers to you something like 4-5 remounts per lap:
3 dirty run-ups + 1 barrier section, 2 muddy u-turns, 2 u-turns with pebbles on
them, what makes them ore dangerous and difficult, 3 rideable uphills, plus mud
and grass - all this guaranteed me a lot of fun and pleasure to deal with.
Weather was unstable, but rather normal - it had been raining before and after
the race, but not during.

Unfortunately, my results was not as great as pleasure I received from the race
- leader of the race, the junior world champion of 2011, passed me in the middle
  of the race, and I finished I lap behind him at the 20th position. Anyway, it
was wonderful and motivated me towards next race!

Race perfectly demonstrated, how many technical skills I miss, and I'm going to
fix this issue as soon as possible.

## 12.10.2013 - Bourg-en-Bresse, Ain, France

Technically this race was simpler then the previous one: only one u-turn, couple
of less technical turn, one barrier section and one serious run-up - excepting
these everything else was rideable. But weather... Weather really went bad before the
my race: in addition to quite low temperatures, rain has decided to start and the
wind was noticeably blowing making the weather really cold. On the start line
I've got the 9th number - not bad. The race has started for me not bad, but
not ideally either: in the first two laps I've fallen two times, my chain dropped once,
and I wasn't able to remount normally. But then,
I've got the rhythm and found the legs, and started to progress.
As a result - I passed several racers and finished on the 9th place on the same
lap with winner of the race - mission completed and my best result in Cross ever! 

As a resume, I'd like to re-post and remember some useful thoughts, which I've found
[here](http://www.cxmagazine.com/post-race-analysis-van-den-ham-column):

> I realized I needed to develop strategy; a strategy that eventually became
> what I like to call careful post-race positive analysis.

> Instead of focusing on the parts of the race that didn’t go well, I’ve found
> it much more helpful to acknowledge where I made mistakes during the race, but
> dwell on my successes.

> being able to manage those highs and lows can be the different between a good
> ’crosser and one who never managed to live up to their potential

> One of the keys to becoming a successful cyclist is to make the highs lower, and
> lows higher; to exhibit a consistently positive mental approach to both training
> and everyday life regardless of the results in any particular race.
