summary: Lows and highs of cyclocross exemplified by one race in France.

The race itself was fun, from one point of view, and a disaster from the
another. The track was quiet easy: almost no serious u-turns, no serious run-ups,
a lot of straight sections, even with asphalted paths, which just needed road
power - in other words, in Rumilly legs defined more than any other skill. The
weather conditions were not anything special, with a bit of rain before the
race, but overall it was warm and humide.

Unfortunately, I've started from the last line and had to fought back through the race.

As the result, I was really charging for the several first laps in order to
catch up with train, not having any possiblity to breathe freely. I enjoyed
the wide lines and pushed to the limit of the grip of my Clement Crusade PDX
clincher tires, resulting in a bit of gliding in corners; also, the rims were
definitively hit couple of times due to the low pressure in tires.

Towards the middle of the race I was able to move close to the middle of the
pack, but that
was all I was able to show. The engine was burned out, no fuel in tanks,
and I had to start just finishing the race - well, at this
moment it was already more time-trial than a race :)

In addition, just before the
leader lapped me, my front wheel went out of control in 90-degrees turn with
gravel and pebbles, and I've fallen and badly scratched the left knee.

Also, bloody marchalls did not correctly registered my result, and
instead of being the 21st, as it can be easily seen on the photos, my finall
ranking converted to the the 31st, which is definitively impossible
considering the number of people I passed. 

So, summarizing all lows and highs of the day:

- I should keep closer to the announcer - usually, if you are not in the call
  list, this is your only chance to occupy relatively good starting position and
  not to be stuck behind slower guys initially and therefore loosing precious time.

- Although track was technically simple, I underestimated the gravel parts and
  some other places, resulting in the small errors here and there and loosing
  time in places where I could gain it; also I've fallen due to weakened
  concentration.

- The good point is the fact, that I pushed the big chainring - 46 teeth - all the time, thus
  proving that **at least** I can try 1x9 transimission: 42 * 11-27 -
  effectively eliminating the front gearshifting.

- The tire pressure for this race was 1.65/1.85 Bars in Front/Rear wheels with
  Michelin 22-23 Latex tubes; I've badly bottomed out couple of times and haven't liked
  the feel. So, probably I should increase the lower limit and pump around
  1.75-1.90 in the front wheel and 1.95-2.1 in the back.

- I'm using the Shimergo 9-speed setup, and it worked flawlessly until the very
  last moment when the right shifter jammed. This fact forced me to investigate
  the situation, and I found, that the return spring of the upshift gear lever
  is not strong enough to always return it to the outermost right position; this somehow
  results in a jam when you what to down-shift with a thumb-lever of Campagnolo.
  So, for the moment the workaround is to move manually the lever with the
  fingers to the extreme right position, and this un-jams the down-shift.
  Ideally, the spring either should be replaced, or correctly pre-loaded during
  rebuild. At least, now I know the reason and can think about a proper solution.

That's all for the moment! Stay tuned and keep crossing :)
