## 27.10.2013 - CC de Rumilly, Haute-Savoie

The race itself was fun, from one point of view, and a disaster, from the other
one. The track was quiet easy: almost no serious u-turns, no serious run-ups,
a lot of straight sections,o even with asphalt, which just need power - in other
words, legs were more the definitive factor here, then anything else, in Rumilly.

Unfortunately, I've started almost from the last line and had to fought back.
Immediately after the departure, the was a barrier and small uphill run, where I
was able to recuperate couple of positions, than narrow section with couple of
turns, that small widening where I've tried to accelerate and pass people;
again, narrow section in the wood with wide turns which gave the possibility to
catch up with another small group. As the final exam after wood section there
was the asphalted uphill, followed by the two 90-degrees turns and then small
singletrack ending with the gravel and muddy downhill with the mud bath in the
bottom. Then two turns again in the form of letter "Z" and long-long-long
straight line, which gives the possibility to the road racer to use there engine
appropriately.

As for me, I was really charging for the several laps, not having any
possiblity to breathe freely. I really enjoyed the wide lines and pushed to the
limit of the grip of my Clement Crusade PDX clincher tires; also, the rims were
definitively hit couple of times due to the low pressure in tires.

Towards the middle of the race I was able to catch up with the midpack, but that
was all I was able to show that day. My engine was
burned out, no fuel, I had to start just finishing the race - well, at this
moment it was more time-trial than a race :) In addition, just before the leader
lapped me, my front wheel went out of control in 90-degrees turn covered with
gravel and pebbles, and I've fallen and badly scratched the left knee.

And in addition, bloody marchalls did not correctly registered my result, and
instead of being the 21st, I started to be the 31st, which is impossible
considering the number of people I passed. Again, "famous" french-type of
organistaion is in place.

So, summarizing all lows and highs of the day:

- I should keep closer to the announcer - usually, if you are not in the call
  list, this is your only chance to occupy relatively good starting position and
  not to be stuck behind slower guys initially and therefore loosing precious time.

- Although track was technically simple, I underestimated the gravel parts and
  some other places, resulting in the small errors here and there and loosing
  time in places where I could gain it.

- The could point was that I pushed the big gear - 46 teeth - all the time, thus
  proving that **at least** I can try 1x9 transimission: 42 * 11-27 -
  effectively eliminating the front gearshifting. 

- I've run the 1.65/1.85 Bars in Front/Rear wheels with Michelin 22-23 Latex
  tubes; I've badly bottomed out couple of times and haven't liked the feel. So,
  probably I should increase the lower limit and pump around 1.85 in the front
  wheel and 1.95-2.1 in the back.
