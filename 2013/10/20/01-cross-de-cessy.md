summary: Cyclocross de Cessy, Championats de l'Ain; the 21st overall position, with hopes for better time :) ![funny_face](/static/img/2013/10/20/131019284.jpg)

## 19.10.2013 - Cessy, Ain, France

Home races are always difficult, although home crowd is usually very supportive. I
didn't have the great legs and have done several pre-start errors:

- Late arrival and bad warm up: I was spinning for only 15 minutes instead of 30
  minutes.

- Did not really understand the first technical part. It contains a lot of
  turns, the majority of them are U-turns with rather solid radius. So as the
  result I lost quite some time finding better trajectories and carrying speed
  through corners

Although I started from the second line, I lost quite a lot of positions
during first two laps. The field was really strong and quite aggressive, but
overall correct. Surpisingly, towards the end of the race I found legs and
trajectories, and started to push harder - may be it was worth doing from the
beginning :)

Overall, it's still possible to mark several positive moments:

- I found good trajectories during the race, and finally understood the idea of
  "carrying the speed through the corners"

- I started to push harder, and that gave me the feeling of proper cross
  pedaling technic; good warm-up is absolutely necessary for this, and today I
  missed it.

- Although two leaders passed me by 1 lap, they are really CX specialists of the
  national level of France; the rest of the top guns stayed on the same lap.

- No problems so far with the remounts in barrier section and after uphill running; in the
  same time, the top guns just bunny-hopped through them :)

Let hope, that proper preparation and speed will come with some efforts from my
side. Cross is wonderful and I really enjoy it every time I do it :)
