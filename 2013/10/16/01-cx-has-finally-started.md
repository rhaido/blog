summary: Brief reviews of the first two CX races of the season. ![run up](/static/img/2013/10/12/155354IMG_5266.JPG)

## 05.10.2013 - Cormoz, Ain, France

Small, compact, but very good and technically difficult race. The track proposed
by organizers offered something like 4-5 remounts per lap on
3 dirty run-ups and 1 barrier section, 2 muddy U-turns, 2 U-turns with pebbles on
them, what makes them ore dangerous and difficult, 3 rideable uphills (one of
the was the asphalted), plus mud and grass almost everywhere - all this guaranteed
me a lot of fun and pleasure. Weather was unstable, but relatively normal - it had
been raining before and after the race, but not during.

Unfortunately, my result was not as great as pleasure I received from the race:
leader of the race, the junior world champion of 2011, passed me in the middle
of the race, and I finished one lap behind him on the 20th position. Anyway, it
was wonderful and motivated me towards next race!

Race perfectly demonstrated, how much I miss in technical field of cross, as
well as physically. Hope to get better!

## 12.10.2013 - Bourg-en-Bresse, Ain, France

Technically the race was simpler and faster then the previous one: no real
U-turns, plenty of 90&deg; muddy and slippery turns, one barrier section and
one serious run-up - excepting these everything else was rideable. But weather...
Weather really went bad before the my race: in addition to quite low temperatures,
it started to rain and the wind was noticeably blowing making the weather really cold.
I've got the 9th plate and a place in second row - not bad at all! The race
departure was not bad as well, but not ideal either: in the first two laps I've
lightly fallen two times, my chain dropped once, and I wasn't able to remount
normally. But then, I've got the rhythm, found the legs and proper trajectories,
and started to progress slowly. As a result - I passed several racers and
finished on the 9th place, on the same lap with the winner - mission completed
and my best personal result in Cross ever! 

As a quick resumé, I'd like to re-post and remember some useful thoughts, which I've found
[here](http://www.cxmagazine.com/post-race-analysis-van-den-ham-column):

- About mind strategy:
> I realized I needed to develop strategy; a strategy that eventually became
> what I like to call careful post-race positive analysis.
>
> Instead of focusing on the parts of the race that didn’t go well, I’ve found
> it much more helpful to acknowledge where I made mistakes during the race, but
> dwell on my successes.

- Higs and lows of sport:
> ... being able to manage highs and lows can be the different between a good
> ’crosser and one who never managed to live up to their potential
>
> One of the keys to becoming a successful cyclist is to make the highs lower, and
> lows higher; to exhibit a consistently positive mental approach to both training
> and everyday life regardless of the results in any particular race. 

That's all for the moment!

Stay connected and happy crossing :)
