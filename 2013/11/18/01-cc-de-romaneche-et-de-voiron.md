summary: Two interesting and difficult races, each one with its "originalité".

## Hautecourt-Romanéche, Ain, 09.11.2013

The track of Hatecourt-Romanéche is really short and technically is rather
simple, but the grass and the soft terrain here play the role of the spice,
small amount of which can completely change the taste of the food :) Heavy rain
the day before just increased the difficulty, making riders choose unobvious
lines and making them understand the cross basics about carrying and saving
speed through the corners.

There was just 14 participants, so even small jams can not really affect your
time. The start was not bad, all riders were quickly distributed all over the
track after the first half, and time trial on the wed and deep grass started.
One more time I realized, that the track can really change after couple of laps
under the wheels of senior category, requiring chaging tactics. I was fixed on
the 8th position, not being able to approach myself to the 7th position, and
on penultimate lap I was passed by Julien Maitre and Lionel Genthon, who were
fighting for the 1st and 2nd place, effectively ending my race.

And what about the basics? The basics, which have been hardly studied from this race,
are:

- Save the speed - the speed should be maintained over all the track. You should
  try to carry as much speed as possible through each corner, each uphill.

- If running the uphill allow you to maintain the speed, run.

- If running the corner allow you to maintain the speed, run.

- Run the flat sections, if it's to bumpy and do not allow you to get enough
  speed on your bike.

- Inertia is the key to save the speed before the run-up. It will relieve a bit
  of the pain in the beginning of the run-up. 

Look at pros. Sometimes they do not even bother themselves with the attempts
to riding the uphill - they immediately start to run. Gods like Sven Nys ride
the difficult section where everybody else runs mainly during the last laps,
keeping it as a secret weaponto make - or to close - gaps over other riders.
But - there is strong and mighty but - average Joe, like me, is very far from his
level of skill, power and equipment, so the choices for him do not suit me, that's
obvious. In other words, do not follow the fashion - follow the reality of life.
Running can be damn better than slowly pushing uphill on a bike.

## Voiron, Haute-Savoie, 17.11.2013

Although the cross is all about your physics, technical skills and strategy, it
also, like the majority things in life, influenced by luck, it presence or
absence. Effectively, I've got everything to have a good race: there were 80 participants
in the race, I've started from the 4th line; the single chainring system worked
flawlessly, and I was fully concentraced on riding track cleanly and slowly
progressing, but the small stone, jammed between the derailleur cage and the pulley
during pushing up to the hill, ended up my race by rupturing the rear derailleur
in two pieces and damaging the derailleur hanger.

That's all for the moment! Stay tuned and happy crossing!
