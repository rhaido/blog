summary: Surprisingly technical and physically challenging race.

It was heavily raining in the morning of the race, promising the if not the
super-slppery course, but the the soft and very "juicy" ground for sure. You can
find the course description on the official site of VC Lancy, although the track
is a little bit varrying from year to year, but always staying within the same
area. 

So, the following set of obstacles was offered this year to the racers: start section on the
asphalt, with the wide and realtively fast u-turn, a bit of the straight
asphalt; plenty of 90-degree turns and and series of Z-turn combos; several
serious and challenging U-turns, especially the one on top
of the climb; 1 barrier section and one very difficult run-up, which drains the
power like a vampire drains blood of a virgin lady; 3 cycle-able uphill parts,
with one of them being very steep even for 38-27 gear combo. The ground were
relatively soft, so plenty of grass and mud were collected on the bike and shoes
after the race.
