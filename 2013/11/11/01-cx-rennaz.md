summary: Although Switzerland is more famous for its MTB stars, the cyclocross is also powerfull in this small mountainous country.![](http://blog.grozak.com/galleries/cx_rennaz_2013/IMG_0722-crop.JPG)

The the next there was UCI C2 in Rennaz, canton Valais of Switzerland. The
weather was awful, the wind was blowing, periodically it was heavily raining;
the parcour was mainly situated on the field, which guaranteed the tons of mud
and good portion of run-ups. No chances without the second bike, just no chance
at all.

Our club was presented by two desperados, two hot heads - Aloïs Falenta, the local powerful
crossman:

\- and Jean-Pierre Prudentino, who has decided to remove dust from his cross bike
this year and come back in bussiness.

The later even broke the rear derailleur during the warm-up, effectively
reducing the number of bike in his disposal to one.

Although swiss top guns prefered the taste of mud with the flavour of belgian beer, i.e.
Flanders, to their home fields, the field was extremely concurent. Ralph Näf and
Lukas Fluckiger, famous MTB riders, were there; Clément Venturini, cyclocross
specialist, professional from Cofidis, 2010-2011 junior cyclocross world champion
was there; Fabien Canal, french MTB specialist; Marcel Wildhaber, professional
from Scott-Swisspower, also cyclocross specialist.

With that level of riders the results was everything but predicted.

Arnaud Grand scored the holeshot and was the leader of the race for
the biggest part of the race:

Lukas Fluckiger was in the charging mode trying to approach to the leader:

Ralph Näf was slowly, by constantly, progressing up:

\- while Clément Venturini was jammed around the 7th position for quite some
time, fighting for the good lines:

Riders from UC Gessienne were placed around the 20th position for the majority
of the race, effectively progressing from the thirties positions.

With the accumulating mud on the bike JP started to slow down; later on he
decided to abandon the race - also because it became to be next to the
impossible to ride. Aloïs, in its turn, was able to finish on the same lap as
leaders on the 18th in the really nasty and gloomy weather conditions, against
the storm wind. Venturini was able to find the legs and pushed to the first
place with the gap of almost 17 seconds to the closest pursuer; Arnaud Grand
finished second and Ralph Näf finished third.

So, this was the hard and difficult cyclocross of Rennaz in Switzerland. All

That's all for the moment! Stay tuned and happy crossing!
