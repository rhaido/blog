I found it
[here](http://asklaurenfleshman.com/questions/six-tips-to-have-your-best-xc-season-ever/),
and would like to repost it in my small blog. In general, all of this tips are
intuitional, but it is always worth to have them written down in more "solid"
form to refresh from time to time.

Here they are (a bit edited and generalized):

> From what little I know about you, these are the six things I recommend you do
> to have the best cross country season of your life:
> 
> ## Run *consistently*
> 25-35 miles a week, with a rest day every week. This number is
> different for everyone based on what they’ve done in the past, but you can
> increase a little bit every year through high school and college.
> ## SLEEP enough
> This is the hardest thing to do in high school, but at least 5
> days a week, you need to get good sleep or the training is pointless, your iron
> will go back down, and blahbadee-blah-blah bad news. Easier said than done I
> know, but make it happen.
> ## DON’T TAKE SHORTCUTS
> It will be tempting all year to get distracted by
> too-skinny girls having short term success. If you want to run in college like
> you say you do, you’ll want to have success that you can build on every year.
> Build your own confidence by not looking around at others too much and working
> with the body you have. It is hard work to do that, but in my opinion, THAT is
> the only success worth having.
> ## Aim for a ... *diet* (you don’t need an A+).
> A+ diets are not sustainable and
> they take so much focus that you can’t focus on your training and your
> happiness.
> ## Brainwash yourself to be a bad-ass.
> “I LOVE to compete. I LOVE how I can
> tolerate pain. I am strong and tough and freaking awesome.” Every quality you
> need this season is inside you. You just have to bring it out with practice.
> Every morning, on your warmups, every night, say those things to yourself.
> Seriously. Pro athletes do it. It works.
