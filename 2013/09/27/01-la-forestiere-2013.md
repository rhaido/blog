      marathon
summary: This french marathon is worth to visit: it combines the best creams of MTB in Franche-Comte and Ain!

On the 22nd of September, for the first time (and hope not the last!!!!) in my life, I've done
[La Forestiere](http://www.la-forestiere.asso.fr/)! 100km of real and
pure MTB marathon, with really scary descents, with wet rocks and stones, mud in
the forest, etc. My starting position was almost the worst of possible - from
the last line, with almost 360-370 participants in front of me, and about 30
behind. But nevertheless, I finished on the 149th position with 6
hours of time.

As I do not have any serious marathon experience, the goals were to pace myself
carefully, eat/drink enough, avoid cramps and leave something for the finish. I
fulfilled my aims for 100% :)

The track... Bloody track is the masterpiece, just a masterpiece of art. It's
wonderful. It perfectly combines flat pedaling parts, steep climbs, very steep
descents through permamently wet rock gardens and roots; even running doesn't
bother you a lot when occasionally you have to do it.
In fact, several descents was so steep, that I touched my
saddle with my breast in order to save control over speed while shitting the
pants! My God, they were extreme and extremely amazing.

The markup was really everywhere - not possible to miss the road. Support on the
track was wonderful - each 10 km you have feeding points with
water, Cola, isotonic, bananas, dry fruits, etc; you can refill your camelback
and bottles there. The crew is also very helpful, the locals cheer you, and the
overall human atmosphere is just amazing.

We were extremely lucky with the weather - although is was very cold in the
morning, wet in forest, out of it during the day was very sunny and warm.
Usually it's nearly raining, and, according to the veterans, the several
times they've had snow!

For me, the toughest part was the last 20 kms, where you encounter your main
rival - yourself - face to face during long-long steep climb. You really can do
it physically, but your brain tells you "noooooooooooooo!".

So, I would definitively recommend visit this MTB race (at least in sunny conditions),
you won't be disappointed.

For this race my setup was: 26er Cannondale Taurine with simple RX Recon Gold, wheels Mavic
UST 819 and Continental X-King 2.4 true UST tires. Bomproof setup, although
extremely heavy. Tires behaved wonderful, good traction and control, no problems
at all.

If you have any question, please, do not hesitate to ask me in comments.

Ride safe and see you soon!
