summary: It's was quite a strange season, and anyway, I'm glad that I sustained it :)

Yep-yep-yep, this season was quite interesting from one side and strange from the other
side. After the 2012 season I was completely burned out, no motivation for trainings
what so ever. I completely abadoned indoor training, only skiis and climbing
made my life a bit more sportive:) So, in the beginning of the season 2013, with very rainy
spring without sunny days, I was completely unprepared, and just hoped, that
everything will return later - but this hasn't happed as well. Mentally - for me -
it was also hard to sustain the fact, that I do not have 29er, thus my rivals
had the principal advantage over me only due to bike. Nevertheless, it turned
out at Championat de l'Ain, that fast guys on 26er-s could still beat the other
fast guys on 29er-s, and that gave me some confidence, that good legs are still
dominant in cycling even with different sizes of the wheels.

What I have really improved this season, are my technical skills. I became much
more confident at the downhill and technical parts of the track; this also led to
the couple of nasty crashes: one during the race and one during the trainig -
thanks God, everything healed fine and I studied a lot as well.

While pedaling up to the mountains during [La Forestiere](http://blog.grozak.com/2013/09/27/01-la-forestiere-2013/)
MTB marathon, I clearly realized the full truth about MTB, and sport in general.
There are always three components of success, which more or less totally depend
on you: your power, your techical skills and your strategy. So, this season I was
able to receive good marks in last 2 skills, but not for the first one. This set
allowed me to race and to finish the races in the middle, have a lot of pleasure,
but do not have results I wanted to have due to lack of the power. Also,
techincal skills and strategy allowed me to pass 200 participants during La
Forestiere marathon race and finish on 149th out of 400 participants while
starting almost from the last line. I got one thought as well - the culmination of the
MTB season should be some beautiful epic marathon, like La Forestiere, where you can
show your abilities and you training results over the time and distance. Of
course, you must not be super-keen on it - everything could happenm and you can
miss it, so you must have "plan B".

Another long-anticipated thing: the cyclocross season is about to start for me!!! That's what I've been
waiting for a long time, and especially for this I've built my Uncle John and
[wheels](http://blog.grozak.com/2013/08/06/01-wheel-build-archetype-shimano-sapim)!
First race will be in Amberieu-en-Bugey this week-end - let see, how it will go
on! I'd like to practice my mount/remount and running skills, and hope it would
not be very flat.

Also, this year, if it will be possible for me, I'd like to participate in
[La Transjurassienne](http://www.transjurassienne.com/presentation/accueil-1-5.htm)
ski marathon, probably on 50km free style distance. The goal will be to finish
and not to have any problems, show stable performance. For this I've already
re-started my fitness trainings, and hope to obtain some power towards february!
Let see, how it will go on!

Thank you for reading and have a good time! :)
