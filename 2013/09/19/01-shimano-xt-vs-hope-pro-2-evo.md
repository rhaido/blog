      review
summary: My usage experience of the eternal rivals of the MTB hub market.

It just happened, that I have both pairs of hubs, and actually extensively used
each of them in conditions of Jura Mountains and Swiss amateur XC racing. Here
is my experience and my conclusion.

## Weight.

Actually, both pairs of hubs have absolutely equal weight: 500 gramms, no less,
no more. Here are the weights:

![Hope Pro 2 Evo](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-4XGten6yY14/UjhZQQp6eHI/AAAAAAAABsg/6q49csE7F5Y/w412-h488-no/IMG_0505.JPG)

So there is absolutely no gain in weight if you use one or another.

## Wheelbuilding.

Here the question becomes a bit more tricky. What is better - higher flange or
smaller one? Obviously - somebody will think - the answer is:

> Higher is better, because it gives shorter spokes, thus stiffer wheels.

*But* - there is always small *but* - there are at least two other factors,
which influence the riding quality of final wheelbuild:
 
- Bracing angle - higher flanges mean sharper angles between spoke and rim, that
  means less load is equally distributed with all the sequences.

- Bearing area of rim/spoke system on the hub itself. Wider is better, smaller
  is worse.

![front overview](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/zdSCm5O3OH9TNR2HZudzHIJAnomIVZvjQpaottpUW4g=w477-h468-no)

Flanges of Shimano hubs are placed a bit wider on the hub, and, due to smaller flange
height, bracing angle is a bit better.

Both Shimano and Hope hubs build just fine for 26 wheels, although I would
prefer Hope for 29.

No clear winner here.

## Freehub.

This is the weak point of Hope hubs, from my point of view. Being very far
from the title of powerful rider, I managed to crack it, because it is
CNC-machined from aluminium alloy. Also, you must tighten the cassette really
gently in order not to overtighten and crack your alu freehub body. I
cracked the return spring for the pawl as well :) 

Shimano, in its turn, uses steel freehub body in XT hub. There were significant
amount of reports about failed freehubs in the beginning of 775 hub series
but, I think, Shimano fixed it and there were no more problems with
it anymore. No need to say, that steel is far more robust
then aluminium, and almost (I do not know any case) never fails!

Hope rear hubs are really famous for their loud ratchet noise,
while Shimano-s, especially after couple of hundreds kilometers, are rather
quiet.

Both rear hubs have very good engagement: 36 PoE in Shimano and 24
in Hope. XT engages itself a bit faster, but this is not critical at all - it is 
pure luxury, and nobody ever failed to win a race due to this.

So here, for me, Shimano wins being more robust, sturdy and with quicker
engagement.

## Axels.

All hubs are supplied with aluminium axels, but Hope shines much brighter
comparing to Shimano: their hubs are able to transform from common QR to 10mm
(DT), 15 mm, 20mm standards for front, and QR, 10mm (DT) etc for rear using
special kits produced by Hope.

From the point of view of versatility Hope wins here.

## Bearings.

The Great Eternal Holywar - *sealed bearings* vs *cup and cone* system.
I used both in very nasty conditions, very dirty ones, from time to time
with liquid mud above the hubs - and Hope died first. There is minimal mud
protection on the rear hub, and driveside freewheel bearing is just exposed to
the mother nature, although I should admit it lasts long enough.

Front hub
has minimal protection: only two caps. After one particularly dirty marathon -
Extreme-sur-Loue in Ornans, France (the WC was there in the same time), the hubs
just stopped spinning at all!

In the same time, Shimano *cup and cone* system has been holding really well
for two years of riding in different conditions of mountains. I overhauled them
several times, and technically they are absolutely fine, although rotation of
the rear hub has some drag, which I am able to detect, but which probably will
not influence my final standing in the protocol. The wheel-rotation overall is
very smooth, and there is no difference for me so far between XT and Hope.

For me, Shimano wins here - simply because Hope died first and I have never
experienced any problem with its opponent.

## Maintenance

Hope hubs are really neat things in terms of maintenance - *if you have a
proper Hope toolset*, which greatly increase your speed and comfort. Just pull out old
bearings, put in *new ones*, put grease in proper places - and voila! - you have 
new hub! As you may notice, I have mentioned two things - tools and new bearings -
that means, you have to buy them, which can be problematic sometimes.

Shimano hubs are more tricky in terms of cup and cone regulation and it is
necessary to have some experience and skill to do it. Once you mastered that
skill - you will be able to do it almost forever with minimum of additional
tools. Bearing balls, cones and axels are available to the aftermarket, so it
is possible to rebuild you hub. It is necessary to watch the state of rear hub
more attentively, and check its free play periodically - but this is also,
although less related, to the Hope hubs.

If you have an instrument, you can even polish Shimano hub cones to receive new hub -
but that goes beyond this review.

From unbiased point of view, no clear winner here - both hubs are absolutely fine in
terms of maintenance.

As I am feeling absolutely fine with maintaining Shimano bearings and as
I do not like to spend extra cash when I can just fix it with some grease and
proper cleaning, Shimano will be my personal choice over Hope.

## Brake rotor mount

CenterLock vs 6-bolt? Personally, I prefer Centerlock because of its simplicity
- I just do not like to work with torx-25 bolts; I find CL being more rigid, than
6-bolt; 6-bolt rotors - XTs in my case - always floated a bit more comparing to
CL XTs; and I greatly trust the proven splines of Shimano. Also, the CL mount
allows to put flanges wider, thus increase the bearing area of the hub.

Mechanically CL is slightly better mechanically and 6-bolt is simpler -
therefore, no clear winner here. For example, for a racing and I will choose
CL all the way, and for touring - 6-bolt mount.

## Customer service.

Living in Europe you can directly profit from __great__, really __great__ Hope
service. It is just unbelievable - I cracked the alu body of the freewheel,
destroyed the bearings, broken the return spring for pawl in one summer of
racing in the rear hub, and Hope just rebuilt the hub from scratch, and now this
hub are like new. That really makes them honour - you know what you pay for, and
you really want to stay with such service level forever! (Better without
destroying hubs).

I can not tell anything about Shimano customer service - have never dealt with 
them, and that is also fine!

## Price.

Pair of Shimano hubs in EU costs around 70 euros (in German shops at least).
Pair of Hope hubs costs at least 230 Euros.

Winner is clear - Shimano XT!

## Resume.

From my point of view - and highly personal - I would use Shimano XT hubs,
because:

- steel freewheel body, overall robustness

- minimum of new instruments for maintenance operations

- cheaper

- personally, I prefer CL over 6-bolts

- slightly better angles for building

From the other site, if you prefer:

- sealed bearings

- 6-bolt

- ability to adapt to different axel formats

- higher flanges

- rebuild simplicity

\- that means, that Hope hubs are probably for you.

I think, that Hope hubs will be slightly better for 29er build from the
wheelbuilding point of view; Shimano-s are just good all-round hubs.

That is all for the moment. Good day and safe riding!

Stay tuned :)
