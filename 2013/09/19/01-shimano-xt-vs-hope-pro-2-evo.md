      review
summary: My usage experience of the eternal rivals of the MTB hub market.

It just happened, that I have both pairs of hubs, and actually used each of them
for quiet some time. Here is my experience and my thoughts about them.

## Weight.

Actually, both pairs of hubs have absolutely equal weight: 500 gramms, not less,
not more. I weighted them both:

![XT](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-XkP4g7gsBUg/UjhZQZOtirI/AAAAAAAABsQ/XQURahmSzKA/w411-h488-no/IMG_0506.JPG)

![Hope Pro 2 Evo](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-4XGten6yY14/UjhZQQp6eHI/AAAAAAAABsg/6q49csE7F5Y/w412-h488-no/IMG_0505.JPG)

So there is absolutely no gain in weight war if you use one or another.

## Flanges.

Here the question becomes a bit more tricky. What is better - higher flange or
smaller one? Obviously - somebody will think - the answer is "higher is better, 
because it gives shorter spokes, thus stiffer wheels". *But* - there is always
small *but* - there are at least two other factors, which influence the final
wheelbuild:
 
- Bracing angle - higher flanges mean sharper angles between spoke and rim, that
  means less load is equally distributed with all the sequences.

- Bearing area of rim/spoke system on the hub itself. Wider is better, smaller
  is worse.

Flanges of Shimano hubs are placed wider on the hub, and, due to smaller flange
height, bracing angle is a bit - really a bit - better. 

Both Shimano and Hope hubs build well for 26 wheels, although I would
prefer Shimano for 26, and probably Hope for 29.

No clear winner here, but I do believe, construction of XT is a bit better.

## Freewheel.

This is the weak point of Hope hubs. Being far
from the title of powerful rider, I managed to crack it, because it is
CNC-machined from aluminium allow. Also, you must tighten your cassette really
gently in order not to overtighten and, therefore, crack you alu freehub body.

Shimano, in its turn, uses steel freewheel body in XT hub. In the beginning of
775 hub series there were significant amount of reports about failed freewheel
bodies, but, I think, Shimano fixed it and there were no more problems with
it. No need to say, that steel is far more robust then aluminium, and almost
(I do not know any case) never fails!

Hope rear hubs are relly famous for their ratchet noise - it is really loud,
while Shimano-s, especially after couple of hundreds kilometers, becoming rather
quiet.

Both rear hubs have very good engagement: 36 PoE in Shimano vs 24
in Hope. XT engages itself a bit faster, but this is not critical at all. It is 
pure luxury,
and no one ever failed to win xc race due to this.

So here, for me, Shimano wins being more robust, sturdy and with quicker
engagement.

## Axels.

All hubs are supplied with aluminium axels, but Hope shines powerfully here
comparing to Shimano: their hubs able to transform from common QR to 10mm
(DT), 15 mm, 20mm standards for front, and QR, 10mm (DT) etc for rear using
special kits, also produced by Hope.

From the point of view of versatility Hope wins here.

## Bearings.

The Great Eternal Holywar - *sealed bearings* vs *cup and cone* system.
I used both in very nasty conditions, very dirty ones, from time to time
with liquid mud above the hubs - and Hope died first. There is minimal mud
protection on the rear hub, and driveside freewheel bearing is just exposed to
the mother nature, although I should admit it lasts long enough. Front hub
has minimal protection: only two caps. After one particularly dirty marathon -
Extreme-sur-Loue in Ornans, France (the WC was there in the same time), the hubs
just stopped spinning at all!

In the same time, Shimano *cup and cone* system has been holding really well
for two years of riding in different conditions of mountains. I overhauled them
several times, and technically they are absolutely fine, although rotation of
the rear hub has some drag, which I am able to detect, but which probably will
not influence my final standing in the protocol. The wheel-rotation overall is
very smooth, and there is no difference for me so far between XT and Hope.

For me, Shimano wins here - simply because Hope died first :)

## Maintenance

Hope hubs are really neat things in terms of maintenance - *if you have a
proper Hope toolset*, which greatly increase your speed and comfort. Just pull out old
bearings, put in new ones, put grease in proper places - and voila! - you have 
new hub! Please notice, that I mentioned two things - tools and new bearings -
that means, you have to buy them, i.e. spend extra cash, you have to find a shop
to buy from, etc.

Shimano hubs are more tricky in terms of cup and cone regulation, it is really 
necessary to have some experience and skill to do it. Once you mastered that
skill - you will be able to do it almost forever with minimum of additional
tools. Bearing balls, cones and axels are available on the aftermarket, so it
is possible to rebuild you hub. It is necessary to watch the state of rear hub
more attentively, and check its free play periodically - but this is also,
although less related to the Hope hubs.

If you have an instrument, you can even polish the cones to receive new hub -
but that goes beyond this review with Hope obviously requiring extra parts for
extra cash.

From unbiased point of view, no clear winner here - both hubs are absolutely fine in
terms of maintenance.

As I am feeling absolutely fine with maintaining Shimano bearings and as
I do not like to spend extra cash when I can just fix it, Shimano will be my
personal choice over Hope.

## Brake rotor mount

CenterLock vs 6-bolt? Personally, I prefer Centerlock because of its simplicity
- I just do not like to work with six torx-25 bolts; I find it more rigid, than
6-bolt: 6-bolt rotors - XTs in my case - always floated a bit more comparing to
CL; and I greatly trust the proven splines of Shimano.

Mechanically CL is slightly better mechanically and 6-bolt is simpler -
therefore, no clear winner here.

## Customer service.

Living in Europe you can directly profit from __great__, really __great__ Hope
service. It's just unbelievable - I cracked the Alu body of the freewheel and
destroyed the bearings in one race - but actually it was the tolerance issue of
the rear hub itself, and Hope just rebuilt the hub from scratch, and now these
hubs are like new. That's wonderful - at least, you know what you pay for, and
you really want to stay with such service level forever! 

I can not tell anything about Shimano customer service - have never dealt with 
them, and that is already fine!

No winner here.

## Price.

Pair of Shimano hubs in EU costs around 70 euros (in German shops at least).
Pair of Hope hubs costs at least 230 Euros.

Winner is clear - Shimano XT!

## Resume.

From my point of view - and highly personal - I would use Shimano XT hubs,
because:

- steel freewheel body, overall robustness

- minimum of new instruments for maintenance operations

- cheaper

- personally, I prefer CL over 6-bolts

- better bracing angles

From the other site, if you prefer:

- sealed bearings

- 6-bolt

- ability to adapt to different axel formats

- higher flanges

\- that means, that Hope hubs are probably for you.

Also, I think, that Hope hubs will be slightly better for 29er build from the
wheel-building point of view; Shimanos are just good all-round hubs.

That's it. Good day and safe riding!
