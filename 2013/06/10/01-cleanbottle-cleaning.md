title: Cleaning Cleanbottle
public: yes
tags: various equipment
summary: Yesterday I decided to completely clean up from molding my cleanbottle bottles.

Cleanbottle - is a great bottle. I use it on a daily basis for my road
trainnigs (unfortunately, I can not recommend to use it for mtb riding). Its
main feature is removable bottom lid, and that is great for keeping your bottles
as clean as possible, but, as we all know, everything is in balance in this
world, and cleanbottle is not an exclusion from this rule. The mold collects
itself in two places in this bottle:

* Under the white sealings
* Around and inside the yellow teat (nipple)
* Inside the top lid, in the deep hole accessible from intenal site.

Happily, cleanbottle could be dissambled and re-assembled really
simply, using two toothpicks. Here is the picture, which I have finally got:

The only difficult places were the extraction of the yellow nose - that should
be done be accurate squeezing the prominent flanges:

The sealing of the bottom lid could be easily extracted with the help of two
toothpicks: you just need to insert one from the inside, rise it a bit, insert
the second toothpick, and then make a circle move in order to turn it out. I
should admit, it's a quite tricky move, but in couple of minutes you should
manage.

Then clean it, wash it, let it dry, reassable and go riding!

P.S. It was the first service in two years of using this bottles.

P.P.S. I store my bottles in the fridge in order to prevent the growing of mold.
