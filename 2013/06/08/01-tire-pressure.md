title: Pressure in my tires
public: yes
tags: wheels
summary: Before I went to sleep, I'd checked the tire pressure of my MTB bike...

* Rear wheel: 1.27 Bar = 18.42 PSI
* Front wheel: 1.15 Bar = 16.68 PSI

What a amazing pressure, amazing grip and comfort, to be honest. Tires - Continental
X-King UST 2.4, rims - Mavic XM 819 Disc UST rims. Bike really became much more
stable, I can corner it harder and more tight, than before.

Anyway, I should increase a pressure up to reasonable rear/front 1.4/1.3 +/-
0.1 bar - and I can feel the difference - depending on the situation.

Have a good day!
