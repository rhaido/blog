summary: Super-epic ride with at least 2300m of elevation.

* Total distance: 148 km
* Total time: 6 hrs
* Average speed: 24.6 km/h
* Max speed: 68 km/h

Today I accompanied Mark Buttner and Simon Buttner (cat 1 french road racer).
We've got a lot of fun sprinting to the bordeline of oncoming villages. 

As for the food, I have tried Sponser Portein 34 and PowerBar Ride for this training. Sponser
Protein 34 with choco flavor was fine, the chocolate cover suprisingly has not melted,
the taste was good and not strong, which is also great.

The chocolate cover of Ride bar from PowerBar melted a bit, but nevertheless, the bar was in consumable
state. Taste was good enough not to leave any bad memories. Still, from my
point of view, the Ride bar is not as good as classical Energizer Bars, because
of the melting chocolate cover, limited taste choice and the overall effect, but it's too
personal to be true for everybody. I'll give it a second try and report later.
