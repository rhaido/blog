Finally, the dream to have and ride polished silver wheelset has come true in the image of
H+Son archetype rims, oldschool Shimano hubs, and
silver Sapim Race double-butted spokes. Some pictures of these round marvels:

The Archetype rim is fashionably wide - 23 mm external/17mm internal width
give to the tire very nice profile (I use 25mm schwable durano performance tire)
with 26.3 mm of width comparing to 24.6 mm of width on Mavic Open Pros:

*   OpenPro:

The build was rather fast: rims are accurate from the box, rigid, hold the tension well, and much
stiffer laterally and radially comparing to OpenPro-s.

Verdict: nice things to work with, good looking wheels and nice riding feelings :))

Have a good time!
